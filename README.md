## Log Returns
Log returns measure the relative change in the price of an asset over a period using the natural logarithm of the ratio of prices.

## Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator used to measure market volatility. They consist of Simple Moving Average (SMA) and two upper and lower bands. The upper band is calculated by adding the standard deviation to the SMA, while the lower band is calculated by subtracting the standard deviation from the SMA.

## Relative Strength Index (RSI)

RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that security.RSI can signal when to buy and sell. Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates overvalued security while a reading of 30 or below indicates undervalued security.

## Ultimate Oscillator (ULTOSC)
The Ultimate Oscillator uses the values of three different moving averages with multiple time periods, short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term periods, to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market, thus improving the accuracy of the signals generated by the indicator. The Ultimate Oscillator is mainly used to identify divergences and give potential buy or sell signals based on those divergences.






## The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a popular technical analysis widely used to predict future trends and to time entries and exits.

### Components of MACD

* MACD Line: This is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.
* Signal Line: This is the 9-period EMA of the MACD Line. It acts as a trigger for buy and sell signals.
* MACD Histogram: This represents the difference between the MACD Line and the Signal Line. It provides a visual representation of the momentum.

### Interpretation of MACD

* MACD Line Crossing Above the Signal Line: This is considered a bullish signal, indicating it might be a good time to buy.
* MACD Line Crossing Below the Signal Line: This is considered a bearish signal, suggesting it might be a good time to sell.
* MACD Histogram: The histogram shows the difference between the MACD Line and the Signal Line. If the histogram is above zero, it indicates positive momentum (bullish), and if it is below zero, it indicates negative momentum (bearish). The height of the histogram bars reflects the strength of the momentum.

## Moving Average

The moving average (MA) is a simple yet effective technical indicator. It smooths out an asset’s price chart by creating a single flowing line that represents the asset’s average price over a given period of time. Moving averages can be used to identify the direction of the trend and trade accordingly. When the short-term moving average (for example, the 20 days one) crosses above the long-term one, it usually signals a bullish trend. If the opposite happens, then a bearish trend is likely to occur soon.

* Simple Moving Average: The average price over a specified number of periods
* Exponential Moving Average: The average price over a specified number of periods but gives more weight to recent prices making it more responsive to new information
