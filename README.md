## Asset Return

This measures the profit or loss generated from an investment in a particular cryptocurrency over a specific period of time.

## Relative Strength Index (RSI)

RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that security.RSI can signal when to buy and sell. Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought situation. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition.

* 14-day RSI: This is the most widely used period and is considered the standard. It strikes a balance between being sensitive enough to detect meaningful changes in momentum without being too volatile.
* 7-day RSI: A shorter period like 7 days can make the RSI more sensitive, which may be beneficial for short-term traders looking for quicker signals. However, it may also generate more false signals due to its increased sensitivity.
* 21-day RSI: A longer period like 21 days smooths out the RSI, making it less sensitive to short-term fluctuations. This can be useful for longer-term investors who want to avoid the noise of short-term price movements.

### Use Buy and Sell Signals That Fit Trends

A related concept focuses on trade signals and techniques that conform to the trend. In other words, using bullish signals primarily when the price is in a bullish trend and bearish signals primarily when a stock is in a bearish trend may help traders to avoid the false alarms that the RSI can generate in trending markets.

### Overbought or Oversold

Generally, when the RSI indicator crosses 30 on the RSI chart, it is a bullish sign and when it crosses 70, it is a bearish sign. Put another way, one can interpret that RSI values of 70 or above indicate that a security is becoming overbought or overvalued. It may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective price pullback. An RSI reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold or undervalued condition.

## The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a popular technical analysis widely used to predict future trends and to time entries and exits.

### Components of MACD
#### The MACD consists of three components:

* MACD Line: This is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.
* Signal Line: This is the 9-period EMA of the MACD Line. It acts as a trigger for buy and sell signals.
* MACD Histogram: This represents the difference between the MACD Line and the Signal Line. It provides a visual representation of the momentum.

### Interpretation of MACD

* MACD Line Crossing Above the Signal Line: This is considered a bullish signal, indicating it might be a good time to buy.
* MACD Line Crossing Below the Signal Line: This is considered a bearish signal, suggesting it might be a good time to sell.
* MACD Histogram: The histogram shows the difference between the MACD Line and the Signal Line. If the histogram is above zero, it indicates positive momentum (bullish), and if it is below zero, it indicates negative momentum (bearish). The height of the histogram bars reflects the strength of the momentum.


## Moving Average

The moving average (MA) is a simple yet effective technical indicator. It smooths out an asset’s price chart by creating a single flowing line that represents the asset’s average price over a given period of time. Moving averages can be used to identify the direction of the trend and trade accordingly. When the short-term moving average (for example, the 20 days one) crosses above the long-term one, it usually signals a bullish trend. If the opposite happens, then a bearish trend is likely to occur soon.

* Simple Moving Average: The average price over a specified number of periods
* Exponential Moving Average: The average price over a specified number of periods but gives more weight to recent prices making it more responsive to new information

## Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator used to measure market volatility. They consist of Simple Moving Average (SMA) and two upper and lower bands. The upper band is calculated by adding the standard deviation to the SMA, while the lower band is calculated by subtracting the standard deviation from the SMA.

BBs have two main use cases in crypto trading.

* Divergence: divergence occurs when the price and BBs are moving in opposite directions. This could be a sign that the price is about to reverse.
* Volatility squeeze: a volatility squeeze occurs when Bollinger Bands narrow sharply, meaning the volatility should be low. Widely radiating bands, on the other hand, indicate high volatility.
